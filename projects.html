                    <h2 class="project-title">Linear Potentiometer Shock Mounts (UBC Baja SAE)</h2>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Designed and manufactured waterjet-cut mounting hardware to integrate linear potentiometers into the Baja SAE suspension system for shock travel data acquisition. Enabled reliable suspension travel measurement under off-road vibration and debris exposure.</p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Our 2025 competition Baja car, Mochi, requires accurate shock travel data for suspension tuning and validation. Off-the-shelf mounting solutions were unsuitable due to tight packaging, suspension geometry, and high vibration. Sensor alignment, durability, and serviceability were critical to prevent sensor damage or noisy data.</p>

                    <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain linear alignment with shock motion throughout suspension travel</li>
                        <li>Withstand off-road vibration, impacts, and debris</li>
                        <li>Manufacturable in-house using waterjet cutting and basic shop tools</li>
                        <li>Integrate cleanly with existing suspension and CAN-based DAQ system</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>

                        <li>Collaboration with electrical teammates integrating CAN data acquisition with STM32 Cube IDE</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>Designed waterjet-cut aluminum mounting brackets tailored to the suspension geometry. Incorporated rigid mounting features to maintain potentiometer alignment during dynamic motion and optimized the design for in-house fabrication, drilling, and tapping.</p>

                    <h3>Manufacturing &amp; Assembly</h3>
                    <p>Waterjet cut brackets in-house for the bottom tabs. For the top mounts, we used roundstock with drilled and tapped holes which were then welded onto the main shock bolt. Manufactured in house, then installed and aligned potentiometers on the vehicle suspension.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome / Impact</h3>
                    <p>Successfully enabled collection of shock travel data through CAN for data acquisition. Improved suspension tuning capability and data reliability during testing and provided a durable, serviceable mounting solution for repeated off-road use.</p>

                        <li>Designed the full keyboard enclosure in Fusion 360, including internal layout and assembly considerations</li>
                        <li>Designed a custom PCB in KiCad centered around a Raspberry Pi Pico</li>
                        <li>Developed the interaction and UI framework for a companion app in Figma and began implementing the app in Swift</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Mechanical Design</h3>
                    <p>Modeled a compact enclosure to house the PCB, keys, wiring, and Raspberry Pi Pico. Designed for easy assembly and iteration as electronics and firmware evolve, balancing durability, accessibility, and visual clarity.</p>

                    <h3>Electrical Design</h3>

                    <h3>Software &amp; Interface Design</h3>
                    <p>Designed the companion app’s interaction flow and UI in Figma with simple, readable layouts and customizable controls; began translating the design into a Swift-based iOS app with accessibility-aware features.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping &amp; Current Status</h3>
                    <p>Enclosure CAD completed and ready for fabrication. PCB design completed and prepared for prototyping. App design finalized in Figma; early Swift development underway. Project remains in active iteration as a work-in-progress.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome / Impact</h3>
                    <p>Established a functional, system-level prototype design spanning hardware and software. Developed hands-on experience integrating mechanical, electrical, and UI design, creating a foundation for an accessible music-learning tool for teens.</p>

                    <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
